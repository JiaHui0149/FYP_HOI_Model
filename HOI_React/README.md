# HOI MODEL

## 1.0 Project Overview
The use of camera surveillance systems has become increasingly popular in ensuring public safety and security. However, a passive surveillance system, which requires manual monitoring and analyzing recorded footage is time-consuming, inefficient and may subject to human errors. It leads to delayed responses and is unable to prevent incidents from happening in the first place. Thus, an active surveillance system, which allows real-time monitoring and alerting of suspicious behavior can help authorities to respond quickly to emergencies and prevent violent acts. To address this issue, our project is to create a HOI model to be used in an active surveillance system to detect and raise potential security threats to authorities  in real-time.
